<h1>Hi there!</h1> 

Glad to see you here.

Recently for the project we've been working on, I built some instant chat features with help of <a href="https://github.com/FaridSafi/react-native-gifted-chat" target="_blank">react-native-gifted-chat</a>, Google Firebase, and <a href="https://github.com/TheEarlyNerd" target="_blank">Kaleb Davenport</a>. The developing process was surprisingly fast, so I decided to write it down in a medium article. This repo has shows its code (besides some firestore functions, which you can get a peek <a href="https://github.com/SherrieCao/Firestore-Algolia-Functions" target="_blank">here</a>.). For more details, stay tuned. 

Cheers
